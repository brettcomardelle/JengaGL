View the User Stories on Trello here: https://trello.com/b/8qeZttF4/4702-jengagl

Remeber to pull before working, commiting before leaving, pushing to master when you complete a story, and creating a new
branch when beginning a new story.

I will merge master branch as frequently as I remember. 

DO NOT DO MORE WORK THAN WHAT YOUR STORY IS ASKING FOR.
